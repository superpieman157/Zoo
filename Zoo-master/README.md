<h3>Objective</h3>
<b>Inheritance in Java</b>
<p>Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Important terminology:</h3>
<p><b>Abstraction:</b> is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.</p>
<p><b>Super Class:</b> The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).</p>
<p><b>Sub Class:</b> The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.</p>
<p><b>Reusability:</b> Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.</p>
